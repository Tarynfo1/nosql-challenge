Using nosql and pandas to analyse food safety ratings data

## # The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

## - Part 1: Set up a Database and Jupyter Notebook
        
## - Part 2: Update the Database
        The magazine editors have some requested modifications for the database before you can perform any queries or analysis for them. 
        
## - Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
        Eat Safe, Love has specific questions they want you to answer, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid.
